The following code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error in Firebase when using transactions with Cloud Firestore.  The issue arises when the transaction callback function throws an error, and the error handling within the transaction isn't robust enough to prevent unexpected behavior. Specifically, the error is swallowed and the transaction might appear to succeed, but the data in the database remains unchanged. This is particularly insidious since the application might believe the operation was completed successfully.
